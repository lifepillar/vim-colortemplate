*libtinytest.txt*	For Vim version 9.0	Last change: 2022 Nov 13

Tiny Test is a minimalist unit testing library for Vim 9 script developers.
A unit test is just a global function without arguments and return value whose
name starts with `g:Test`. Typically, tests contain Vim assertions (see
|assert-functions-details|). For instance:
>
	vim9script

	def! g:Test_OnePlusOneIsTwo()
	  assert_equal(2, 1 + 1)
	enddef
<
To run the tests, source a script that imports Tiny Test and sources your
tests:
>
	vim9script

	import 'libtinytest.vim' as tt
	source <sfile>:h/my_tests.vim

	const success = tt.Run()
	echo success
<
The outcome appears in a new scratch buffer.

Note: since tests are global functions, it is not possible to delete them. If
you rename or delete a test from your test suite, you will probably want to
restart Vim to run tests from a clean state.

					*libtinytest.Run()*

Runs a test suite. The function has an optional argument, which is a pattern
to filter the test names. For instance, to run only the tests containing
`ABC`, you may write:
>
	const success = tt.Run('ABC')
<
This will run `Test_ABC_Foo()` and `TestABCBar()`, but not `Test_XYZ()`.
